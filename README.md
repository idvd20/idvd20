# Hi there 👋, I'm Ian!

I'm a chemical engineer turned software engineer, and I'm thrilled that I made the switch! So far, I really enjoy learning and working as an engineer in this field. I'm always looking to develop my skills as an engineer, home brewer, climber, pet parent, and husband. There is so much to learn!
